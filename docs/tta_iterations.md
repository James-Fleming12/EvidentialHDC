# Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) Iterations

## Goal: the target each TTA method must chase

The prototype decoder is not exhausted. Re-estimating the 10kD prototypes from the corrupted stream **with true labels** (the full-label oracle) recovers the collapsed conditions on the **full scene, no points removed**, and the result is pool-size-stable (200k / 500k / 1M pools agree; Phase 24.10). The project goal is a **label-free TTA method whose prototype re-estimation replicates the oracle's per-point weighting**, reaching each condition's oracle mIoU without labels.

### Per-condition targets

| Condition | Zero-shot mIoU | Full-label oracle (target) | Gain to close |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fog** | 10.1% | **16.6%** | +6.5 |
| **Crosstalk** | 12.0% | **26.2%** | +14.2 |
| Wet Ground | 49.0% | 51.2% | +2.2 |
| Cross Sensor | 41.5% | 43.6% | +2.1 |
| Snow | 39.4% | 40.7% | +1.3 |
| Incomplete Echo | 41.2% | 41.2% | 0.0 |
| Beam Missing | 53.7% | 53.6% | −0.1 |
| Motion Blur | 44.3% | 44.8% | +0.5 |

**Reading the table:**
- **Fog and crosstalk are the primary targets** (the only conditions with large label-gated headroom; full-scene, no point removal).
- **The geometric conditions are already at or near the oracle**: a TTA method must not regress them; their target is "hold zero-shot."
- **Key constraints learned so far:**
  - Artifact-free selection ≈ full-label (Phase 24.9): the problem is estimating the oracle's per-point *weights*, not dropping artifacts.
  - Every self-supervised variant tested so far fails to reach the oracle: naive EMA (fog 9.3), soft-dual-weight (9.4), BN-stat alignment (10.7), artifact gating (retained-subset only), prior correction (closed), prototype rebalancing (flat). The oracle is the only thing that moves fog full-scene.

## Baseline: where every tested TTA variant currently lands

Full-scene mIoU, plain medium encoder, Phase 24.9 harness (200k pool / 100k val):

| Condition | Zero-shot | naive EMA | SDW | BN-align | Full-label oracle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| fog | 10.1% | 9.3% | 9.4% | 10.7% | **16.6%** |
| crosstalk | 12.0% | 10.7% | 10.6% | 15.1% | **26.2%** |
| snow | 39.4% | 38.1% | 37.9% | 39.9% | 40.7% |
| wet_ground | 49.0% | 47.7% | 47.4% | 40.5% | 51.2% |
| incomplete_echo | 41.2% | 39.4% | 39.2% | 40.6% | 41.2% |
| beam_missing | 53.7% | 51.6% | 51.4% | 53.6% | 53.6% |
| motion_blur | 44.3% | 43.0% | 42.8% | 44.8% | 44.8% |
| cross_sensor | 41.5% | 39.7% | 39.4% | 42.6% | 43.6% |

**The gap to close**: the difference between the "label-free TTA" columns and the "full-label oracle" column, which is ~6-14 mIoU on fog/crosstalk and ~0-2 on the geometric conditions.

## Iteration Log

### Iteration 0: setup (context from the oracle phases, no TTA run yet)

- Phase 24.9 established the harness (`--tta_oracle`): TTA battery + prototype-oracle bounds on a shared seeded pool/val split, full-scene acc + mIoU.
- Phase 24.10 established the target: the full-label oracle is pool-size-stable and beats zero-shot on fog/crosstalk; the prior "oracle crashes fog to 4.9%" claim (Phase 21) was not reproduced by the current harness and is flagged for reconciliation.

### Iteration 1: the learned loss-estimator head (proposed, not yet run)

The leading candidate: a small head trained (on clean/self-supervised signal) to predict each point's cos-to-true at test time, used as the per-point weight in a prototype re-estimate (Phase 24.4 #3). Rationale: the oracle's advantage over every label-free variant is exactly the per-point cos-to-true it has and they lack; the loss is the single sharpest artifact/relevance signal measured (Phase 22.2), and it is estimable in principle from the 128D geometry on clean data.

Success criterion: fog full-scene mIoU moving from ~10% toward 16.6%, and crosstalk from ~12% toward 26.2%, without regressing the geometric conditions beyond their zero-shot level, with a label-free (or clean-only-supervised) estimator.
