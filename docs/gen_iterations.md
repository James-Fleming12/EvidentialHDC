# Generalizing the Feature Extractor for Corruptions: Preliminary Testing

Based on the Corruption Atlas diagnostics, we have mathematically proven that **Type C corruptions (Fog, Crosstalk)** fundamentally destroy the linear separability of the geometric manifolds. A purely mathematical Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) technique (like Memory Banks or Prototype Shifts) is powerless because the underlying feature space has collapsed into isotropic noise. 

To solve this, the **128D Backbone** must be explicitly trained to map physical noise to clean semantic manifolds (or isolate it) *before* the HDC projection layer.

This document outlines our **Preliminary Diagnostic Test**. Before committing to a massive 60-epoch overnight pre-training run, we are testing three highly-aligned mathematical constraints in a "micro-pretraining" shootout.

## The Three Aligned Methodologies

We have identified three strategies perfectly aligned with sparse 3D point cloud architecture that aggressively target Type C domain shifts:

### Method 1: Unnormalized Supervised Contrastive (SupCon)
- **Concept:** Pull augmented views of the same class together while pushing different classes apart.
- **Why it Aligns:** Traditional SupCon requires massive batch sizes, but because LiDAR segmentation is dense, a single batch of 1 provides ~100,000 points (millions of positive/negative pairs natively). 
- **The Modification:** We apply SupCon on **unnormalized 128D features**. Standard $L_2$ normalization fatally stretches zero-signal noise to a magnitude of 1.0 (the Inlier Paradox). Without normalization, destroyed points will lack gradient signal and naturally collapse toward the origin ($\Vert z \Vert_2 \approx 0$).

### Method 2: Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB)
- **Concept:** Force the network to "forget" everything about the input that isn't strictly necessary for semantic prediction.
- **Why it Aligns:** Requires only changing the final linear projection from `128` output to `256` output (Mean + Variance). 
- **The Modification:** A KL-divergence penalty forces the latent distribution to match a standard normal prior $\mathcal{N}(0, I)$. Complex, high-entropy spatial noise (Fog/Crosstalk) is mathematically expensive to memorize, so the network minimizes the loss by letting the penalty drag the noise straight to the origin ($\mu = 0, \sigma^2 = 1$). This guarantees perfect magnitude isolation.

### Method 3: Local Smoothness (Dirichlet Energy Regularization)
- **Concept:** Prevent highly oscillatory, high-frequency decision boundaries that are vulnerable to random scattering noise.
- **Why it Aligns:** Requires absolutely **zero architectural modifications** and consumes very little VRAM.
- **The Modification:** We add a Dirichlet Energy penalty to the feature graph ($\lambda \sum \| z_{point} - z_{neighbor} \|^2$). Transient noise points (like a Fog point near a solid building wall) are absorbed into the building's robust local geometry rather than snapping to a distinct noise cluster.

## Non-Leaking Data Augmentation Pipeline
To teach these invariances without overfitting to KITTI-C's specific ray-tracing algorithms, all three methods will train against generic physical degradation:
1. **Voxelized Random Dropout (Sparsity):** Drop entire spatial voxels instead of uniform points. (Simulates *Beam Missing / Incomplete Echo*).
2. **Anisotropic Gaussian Jitter (Sensor Noise):** Heavy Gaussian noise applied strictly along the ray-axis (distance from sensor). (Simulates *Crosstalk*).
3. **Global/Local Density Subsampling:** Randomly decimate point density in specific angular quadrants. (Simulates signal attenuation like *Fog / Snow*).

## The Diagnostic Script: `micro_pretrain_eval.py`

To definitively rank these methods, we will implement a rapid-prototyping script that executes the following pipeline in one continuous run:

### Phase 1: Micro-Training
- **Data:** 10% subset of the clean SemanticKITTI training split.
- **Competitors:** Instantiate 4 lightweight backbones: Baseline (Cross-Entropy), Unnormalized SupCon, VIB, and Local Smoothness.
- **Epochs:** Train all 4 models for exactly 5 epochs using the physics augmentations. (Should take <1 hour total).

### Phase 2: Latent Extraction
- Freeze all 4 backbones.
- Pass a fixed subset of 50 Clean frames and 50 Fog frames through the networks.
- Extract the raw, continuous 128D features (bypassing the HDC layer completely).

### Phase 3: The 128D Headroom Metrics
The script will automatically evaluate the raw 128D geometry of the Fog frames against the Clean frames, calculating the winning criteria:

1. **Cosine Shift ($\Delta f$):** The average cosine distance between the clean 128D centroid and the Fog 128D centroid. 
   - *Winning Criteria: Minimizes this shift, proving the geometry resists drift.*
2. **Target Neighborhood Purity (1-NN):** Query Fog points against their own local 128D neighborhood. 
   - *Winning Criteria: Pushes 1-NN purity back up to >90% (Baseline is ~75%).*
3. **Magnitude Segregation (Artifact Isolation):** Measure the average $L_2$ norm of correctly classified points vs. semantic hallucinations. 
   - *Winning Criteria: Maximizes the magnitude gap (e.g., Clean points > 5.0, Noise points < 1.0), allowing a trivial pre-HDC threshold gate to veto unrecoverable points.*
